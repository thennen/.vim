Vundle requires git (mysysgit)
and "Curl", part of mysysgit, but had to create C:\Program Files\Git\cmd\curl.cmd

mkdir C:\tmp

make sure git is in path

git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
:PluginInstall

vim-ipython wouldn't run with anaconda due to some dependency issue.  Modified gvim.exe per
https://github.com/ivanov/vim-ipython/issues/95

set environment variables PYTHONHOME and PYTHONPATH to the place where python.exe is
C:\Users\t\Anaconda3

Use linux naming convention, create symbolic links to .vim and .vimrc, this is so you can have your .vim stuff all in one place and use git.
mklink /d vimfiles .vim
mklink _vimrc .vim\.vimrc
mklink _gvimrc .vim\.gvimrc

change the font or something
